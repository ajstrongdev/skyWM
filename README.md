# skyWM

skyWM is an extensible tiling Window Manager written in Rust using the [penrose Window Manager library](https://github.com/sminez/penrose).

skyWM has a clear and distinct focus adhering to the KISS and Unix philosophy. As such, no additional tools such as a status bar, wallpaper utility (such as feh) or lock screen are provided by default, however can be added by the user.

* To customise skyWM to your liking you can edit the main.rs file directly to add your own custom keybindings, startup processes and more. Once you have customised skyWM you can recompile and utilise it for your setup.

## Installation

skyWM is not currently packaged for any Linux distribution. 

Please see [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/MrBeeBenson/skyWM/blob/main/docs/INSTALL.md) to build it from source.
